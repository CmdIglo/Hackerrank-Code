This Repo is about the Python challenges on hackerrank.com . You will find the source code for the solutions to the problems I solved. 

The source code is mine but can be used for everybody. Just note, that the code I provide may not always be the most efficient way to solve a problem, but if you understand
the code, it will be very helpful for you, to solve the challenges by yourself.

Note: I will not upload the source code for every problem's solution. Also I like to write my solutions in following format: 
def main():
  ...
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
  
where "main()" is the function where all the magic happens and "if __name__ == "__main__"" is the beginning of the actual executable code.
